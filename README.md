# The Container Ecosystem Project

The ecosystem of awesome new technologies emerging around containers and microservices can be a little overwhelming, to say the least. We thought we might be able to help: welcome to the Container Ecosystem Project. The goals of this project are (1) to clearly lay out the different types technologies that make up the growing container ecosystem and the microservices technology stack – starting from the lowest levels of core container technology, and rising up through layers of abstraction to full-blown container platforms and support tools – and (2) to put forth the latest and greatest examples of each type of technology.

## Core Container Technologies

*Use these tools to run a small number of containers on a single host*

#### Container specifications

An abstract definition of a standard "container", allowing an ecosystem of technologies to support a standard container with potentially multiple, interchangeable runtime implementations

* **Docker open source**
  * [Open Container spec](https://github.com/appc/spec): open industry standard for container runtimes; supported by Docker, CoreOS, and most industry leaders; backed by the [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](http://www.opencontainers.org/) (run by the Linux Foundation); currently absorbing CoreOS's AppC standard

* **CoreOS open source**
  * [AppC](https://github.com/appc/spec) (deprecated): CoreOS is now supporting the OCI


#### Container runtimes

This is your actual running container (essentially an abstraction of Linux kernel components like namespaces and cgroups that allow virtualization on top of a shared kernel)

* **Docker open source**
  * [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc): Docker's container runtime, now donated to the OCI as the initial implementation of the standard; essentially a repackaging of libcontainer
  * [libcontainer](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/tree/master/libcontainer): a Linux container library; enables and abstracts interactions with Linux kernel components to create and control containers

* **CoreOS open source**
  * [rkt](https://github.com/coreos/rkt): CoreOS's container runtime; initially an implementation of the AppC specification, which is now being rolled into the OCI spec

* **Other open source**
  * [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/): a Linux container library; originally utilized by runc until release of libcontainer
  * [OpenVZ](https://openvz.org/Main_Page): a Linux container library


#### Container management

* **Docker open source**
  * [Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/docker-engine) (aka "Docker"): the core of Docker and its primary interface; creates and runs Docker containers; includes:
    * Docker daemon: runs as a process on the host machine and provides an API that abstracts basic container control functions
    * Docker client: a CLI for interacting with the Docker daemon

* **CoreOS open source**

## About the Container Ecosystem Project

Here at [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/), the container-native visibility company, we talk to a lot of people in the container ecosystem: both consumers and producers of technology. And wow, there is a LOT of cool technology out there – and so much more coming out all the time. It can be hard to keep up with, even if you're a seasoned expert, much less as a curious newcomer just trying to figure out where to start. There are plenty of great guides out there for various container technologies and use cases (see below for some links). But we had yet to find a clearly organized survey of the different core technologies that make up the container ecosystem and the typical microservices stack. So we decided to make one: the Container Ecosystem Project.

For each type of technology, we've tried to provide a brief description, as well as list examples currently available for that technology. We've separated out open source solutions from commercial offerings. Two of the leading open source container technology producers, Docker and CoreOS, each get their own sections. Throughout the doc, we've tried to mark beta technologies and parent technologies accordingly. 

This framework is not, of course, a perfect science, and this will be a work in progress. If you have any suggested edits, please [tweet us](https://twitter.com/sysdig) or submit edits/pull requests. We'll do our best to keep this document up to date and prune off deprecated or abandoned technologies as the ecosystem evolves.
